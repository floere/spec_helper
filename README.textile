h1. Spec Helper Gem

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not to be taken seriously! It is an idea I had after 63 beers and 400g of barely cooked meat.

h2. Motivation

Are you tired by having to do

@require File.join( File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)), 'spec_helper' )@

on top of each spec file to require the spec_helper?

h2. Usage

Gemfile:

@gem 'spec_helper'@

Spec file:

@require 'spec_helper'@

h2. Other note

Please hold the tomatoes. Thanks! ;)

If someone wants the Gem name for serious purposes, please contact me and I will give it to you.
